# Smart ML Model Trainer & Predictor

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning (ML) model using Python to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing an ML model, from data preprocessing and analysis to training, evaluation, and deployment along with automated feature engineering, improved preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📌 How It Works

1. Upload a dataset in CSV format.
2. Select the target column for prediction.
3. The system detects the problem type (classification or regression).
4. Preprocessing pipelines handle missing values and feature encoding.
5. Multiple models are trained and compared based on performance.
6. The best model is saved and can be used for future predictions.
7. Users can evaluate and visualize model performance through Streamlit.
